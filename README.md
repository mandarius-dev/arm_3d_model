# Industrial manipulator - 3D Model of the arm
## Foreword
This is a repository that is a part of five that are meant to help in designing a six degree-of-freedom manipulator.
Repositories:
 1. Source Code Package
 2. 3D Model Spawner Package 
 3. MatLab Scripts
 4. **Model of the arm**
 5. User Interface in LabView

## Content 
This repository contains all the `blender` files along with the `std` files of the whole manipulator.

If the models are 3D printed there will be a need to sand down some of the pices. 

All of the 3D model where design in Blender and with the help of the `3D-Print Toolbox` all of them are ready for printing. Each link components are in their corresponding folders. Common parts are placed in the `common_pieces` folder. 

## Assembly instruction
Below is some visual instruction of how to assemble the manipulator. Some scrows are necesary to attached some of the pieces together. It is higly recomended to look around the pieces and at the visual instructions in order to have a smooth assembly.
